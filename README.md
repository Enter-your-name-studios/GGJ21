In this game, you play as the owner of Animal Shelter. Your core task is to help lost stray animals find their new home and new friends. You need to help your visitors choose a pet based on their preferences. Every visitor give you a short phrase which is a hint for a pick, and then decide which pet is best for them. Some phrases are odd but pay attention to every pet's special features, like spiked collar, pirate eye patch, or gold chain. Every day in Animal Shelter is a time trial so try to complete the task

# What is Global Game Jam?
The Global Game Jam is the world's largest game jam event taking place around the world at physical locations. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games, while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. The GGJ encourages people with all kinds of backgrounds to participate and contribute to this global spread of game development and creativity.
